/*

(This is a slightly harder version of the fix34 problem.) Return an array that
contains exactly the same numbers as the given array, but rearranged so that
every 4 is immediately followed by a 5. Do not move the 4's, but every other
number may move. The array contains the same number of 4's and 5's, and every 4
has a number after it that is not a 4. In this version, 5's may appear anywhere
in the original array.


fix45([5, 4, 9, 4, 9, 5]) → [9, 4, 5, 4, 5, 9]
fix45([1, 4, 1, 5]) → [1, 4, 5, 1]
fix45([1, 4, 1, 5, 5, 4, 1]) → [1, 4, 5, 1, 1, 4, 5]
